DroidTV
=======

Based on my [previous project for Archos Gen8 devices only][1] this app will provide [DVB][4] scanning, tuning and watching (e.g. local streaming) capabilities.

As soon as it hits a stable version, it will be available on the Android Market for free: [DroidTV][2]


Feel free to fork, create issues, [buy me a beer][3] or just having fun watching some live tv!

If you fork it, feel free to send me pull requests for your awesome new features or bug fixes so they'll make it on the market.
